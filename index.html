			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>I am a web developer, using various languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My aim is
					to work in the tech industry to design beautiful, interactive, robust, and responsive websites.
					My roots are here in Louisville, where I was born and raised. I studied at the University of Louisville
					for my undergraduate studies and pursued a degree in Philosophy. Now I am seeking a career in coding
					as an avenue to express my creativity and help business and individuals achieve their dreams.

			<h2>Work Background</h2>
				<p>
					Warehousing has been my career for the past ten years. I have worked in several roles,
					from team leadership to problem-solving, analyzing production metrics, shipping and receiving, 
					forklift driving, and order fulfillment. I worked for Amazon for three years and I have worked
					for Northern Safety for the past six-and-a-half years. Before that I've worked in various roles
					of customer service and retail.

			<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<p>
					Watching TV shows is one of my favorite things to do. I love good story, comedy, drama, and
					shows that make you think. Some of my favorite shows are Breaking Bad, Stranger Things, the IT 
					Crowd, and Avatar: The Last Airbender. Boardgaming is also near and dear to my heart. There are 
					so many great boardgames out today, from simple card games to elaborate, complex strategy games.
					I think there's a boardgame for everyone! I also like going for walks and spending quality time
					with friends.

			<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					Most of my family lives in Louisville. My Dad first introduced me to coding several years back, 
					and his influence is a huge reason why I decided to participate in Code Louisville. 
					My church also plays a very important role in my life. I go to Sojourn East Community Church in 
					St. Matthews and have been there since 2014. There's no value that can be placed on the friendships 
					I have made there.
